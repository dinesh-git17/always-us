## Introduction

Always Us is a private, intimate app designed for two partners to share meaningful moments together. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles information. In short: your privacy is absolute. The app does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data.

---

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any information.**

Always Us operates entirely on your device. The app does not:

- Collect personal information
- Create user accounts or profiles
- Track your activity or usage patterns
- Access your contacts, photos, location, microphone, or camera
- Use device identifiers or advertising identifiers
- Connect to external servers or cloud services

---

## How Information Is Used

Because the app does not collect any information, there is no data to use, process, or analyze. All interactions with the app remain private and exist only on your device.

---

## Data Storage and Security

Any preferences or settings you configure within the app (such as a personal PIN) are stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage mechanisms. This data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted over the internet
- Is not accessible to the developer or any third party
- Is protected by your device's built-in security features, including device passcode and encryption

If you delete the app, all locally stored data is permanently removed from your device.

## Data Sharing

**We do not share any data.**

There is no data to share because we do not collect any. The app does not contain:

- Analytics or tracking tools
- Advertising networks
- Third-party SDKs that collect data
- Social media integrations
- Any form of data transmission

---

## Children's Privacy

Always Us is intended for adults in a relationship. The app does not knowingly collect information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Because no data is collected, there is no risk of inadvertent collection of children's information.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Continued use of the app after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
