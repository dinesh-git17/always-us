This is not a normal app.

It's a love letter, wrapped in code, delivered as an experience. A 14-page journey through words that were chosen carefully, revealed slowly, and meant completely.

There's no dashboard. No notifications. No engagement metrics. Just warmth, typography, and the deliberate passage of time.

---

## What This Is

**Always Us** is a personal app I built for someone I love.

It's a gift. Not a product, not a startup, not a portfolio piece. It happens to be native iOS, built with React and TypeScript and Capacitor. It happens to use Framer Motion for animations. It happens to be engineered with real care.

But none of that is the point.

The point is the words inside.

---

## What This Isn't

- A side project to impress anyone
- Something optimized for conversion
- Open for contributions (it's finished)
- Built to scale

This app has an audience of one.

## On Craft

Since you're here, you might notice some things.

**Every animation was chosen, not defaulted.** There's no single "fade in" across the app. Each page has its own emotional pacing: _reassurance_ for calm pages, _anchor_ for heavy ones, _finale_ for the ending. Some text staggers at 0.25 seconds. Some at 0.8. The difference is felt, not seen.

**Typography is treated as emotional architecture.** Serif for titles. Book-weight body text with generous leading. Optical alignment corrections measured in hundredths of an em. The goal was simple: make it feel like holding something real.

**Time is a design material.** The welcome screen takes about seven seconds to fully reveal. That's intentional. Rushing would defeat the purpose. Some experiences deserve patience.

**The app breathes.** After the final words appear, the signature text gently pulses. 1.0 to 0.85 opacity, four-second cycle. Just enough to feel alive without demanding attention.

Is this overengineered for what it is? Absolutely.

Did it deserve it? Also yes.

---

## Small Joys

- This app has more emotional state than Redux.
- There's a passcode screen that recognizes when the right person opens it.
- Background music fades in over four seconds at 18% volume. Just enough to sit beneath your thoughts.
- Quotes rotate each session, so returning feels slightly different every time.
- The non-refundable clause page exists, and it's legally binding in the heart.

## A Note for Recruiters

Hi. You probably found this by accident, and that's okay.

This isn't a portfolio piece. I didn't build it to demonstrate skills or hit technical checkboxes. I built it because some things matter enough to build well.

That said, if you're looking at this and wondering whether I care about the details:

Yes. I really do.

The TypeScript is strict. The accessibility is considered. The animations are intentional. The code is clean not because someone might read it, but because building things carefully is how I work.

I also build serious production software. This one just happens to be personal.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to talk about the serious stuff. But I hope you can appreciate why this README doesn't have deployment instructions.
